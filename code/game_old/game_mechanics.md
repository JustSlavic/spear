## Preamble

I want to try following.
List all game mechanics here, give all of them unique identifier,
then mark source code with the `@feature 1234`, which will serve
as a reference to this doc.
That way I may not forget which part of code serve which mechanic,
how all of them connect with each other, and history of changes.

## List of game mechanics

1. @feature1: Select a tile with a mouse pointer.
2. @feature2: Free camera.
3. @feature3: Moving between tiles has animation time.
